# polybar
my polybar config
This was what I had modified my Polybar to look like when I was still using <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a> - tiling window manager.

I don't remember who I copied most of the code from, but I did it by just basically looking at their code and modifying mine to look how I wanted it to look. Don't JUST be copying and pasting.
